#RFP Response Generation Tool

##Overview

Request For Proposal (RFP) is a document that solicits a proposal by government or company or any organization, usually they ask for certain questions to understand the capability of the bidders and why they are best suited to win this proposal. Every year, UHG has been submitting and winning multiple RFPs. In some of the RFPs, questionnaire document runs into hundreds of pages easily with lot of questions. Currently, there are multiple teams in UHG who write responses to these questions manually. This requires huge amount of time and resources. We want to utilize the recent advancements in LLM models to benefit these teams by automating the response generation for such questions in the RFP documents.

##Stakeholders
Business Partners - Optum Growth Operations.

##Role of OptumAI
Develop an Intelligent agent using generative AI that can craft RFP responses in a detailed manner by referring to the prior RFP responses available in templates. We tend to use the RFP Question & Answer bank from the records of the Growth Office that can be used as reference templates.

##Solution Approach
Our proposed solution includes two phases. In first phase, we do the document preparation and in second phase, we do the RFP response generation.
